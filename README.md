## Run on Mac
 - install the app
 - run "xattr -cr /Applications/sauron.app" to disable signature verification (it says that the app is damaged without this command)

## What is this app?

Sauron is an app for searching the database (currently only Postgres and ClickHouse are supported) so mostly just running selects and showing results in a pretty format

## Some cool features:
 - formatting json in results
 - saving queries and results of queries
 - you can click on a row and it will open a view with full values of all columns
 - you can go up and down the results table with j and k or with arrow keys
