## Run on Mac
 - install the app
 - run "xattr -cr /Applications/sauron.app" to disable signature verification (it says that the app is damaged without this command)

## What is this app?

Sauron is an app for searching the database (currently only Postgres and ClickHouse are supported) so mostly just running selects and showing results in a pretty format

## Some features that i couldn't find in other apps:
 - formatting json in results
 - saving results of queries

## Quick Demo:
